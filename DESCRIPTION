Description: The CEMiTool package unifies the discovery and the analysis 
	of coexpression gene modules in a fully automatic manner, 
	while providing a user-friendly html report with high quality graphs. 
	Our tool evaluates if modules contain genes that are over-represented by 
	specific pathways or that are altered in a specific sample group. 
	Additionally, CEMiTool is able to integrate transcriptomic data with interactome 
	information, identifying the potential hubs on each network.
